# Languages symbols

This table gives you the symbol to use for your text's language.

## Disclaimer
A language is in this list because I've found stop words for it.
It does not mean the text analyser will work with it! (As it uses characters like '.' or '?' to determine the end of a sentence.)  
  
Furthermore, I just picked the stop words [here](https://code.google.com/p/stop-words/). I have not checked them.
